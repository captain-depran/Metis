# Metis
Dumb orbital mechanics simulator for spacecraft, that I hope to turn into a mission planner/manouver planner.
Began its life in python, this represents my port to C++

Included is a trajectory_viewer python program to allow you to visualise any data that the code spits out, and an example bodies.cfg input file containing orbital parameters for the earth and the moon.

Only need to download the .py file, the .exe file and the INPUT/OUTPUT folders
